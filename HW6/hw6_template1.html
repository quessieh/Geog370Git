<h1>Homework 6: Census data choropleth </h1>
<h2>QUESSIE HUNT</h2>
<h3> The map below depicts the Public Health Insurance Coverage Population for Counties in North Carolina. This depiction is represented by a map of North Carolina, labeled with the county, and each county has a different color pertaining to the population size, as seen in the legend to the top left.  I created this map from a large data set that was obtained from the Census site and condensed the data into county and population in Excel. After admitting the data into QGIS, I then created a new layer by manipulating the Attribute Table in QGIS and was able to show counties and data populations in North Carolina only. I then joined the layers, thus displaying a North Carolina Map organized by county and population. I added symbology for the population by changing the gradient of the map and creating labels for the county.  </h3>
